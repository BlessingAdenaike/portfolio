										<h2>Project Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This project focuses on a Hospital Transaction Dashboard designed to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for a healthcare facility. The dashboard provides detailed insights into hospital revenues, expenses, profits, patient demographics, and doctor performance. The primary aim of this analysis is to track and analyze the Private Care hospital's financial health, understand patient visits, and evaluate the performance of doctors, specialties, and procedures. The key metrics presented in the dashboard help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding hospital operations and improve patient care and hospital management.</p>

												<h3>Analysis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The analysis reveals that Dermatology and Cardiology are the leading specialties, contributing the most to the hospital’s revenue. These specialties are clearly performing well and expanding them could lead to continued success. Moreover, Skin Biopsy and Pediatric Vaccination are the top-performing procedures, contributing significantly to the hospital's income. This insight suggests that focusing on these procedures could provide more opportunities for revenue generation.
                                                Additionally, the fluctuation in patient visits by quarter suggests seasonality or external influences affecting patient traffic, highlighting the need for the hospital to plan accordingly for staffing and resources during slower periods.
                                                Finally, while there is an apparent imbalance in the gender distribution of doctors, with a higher number of male doctors, the gender distribution among patients remains relatively balanced. This could indicate that there is room for the hospital to improve its doctoral recruitment strategy by focusing on gender diversity, which may enhance both patient satisfaction and workplace inclusivity
                                                .</p>

												<h3>Recommendations</h3>
											</header>
											<p>To capitalize on its financial performance, the hospital should consider expanding its Dermatology and Cardiology specialties, as they are the highest revenue generators. Hiring additional specialists in these fields or increasing the services offered could help further boost revenues. Additionally, procedures such as Skin Biopsy and Pediatric Vaccination should be promoted, as they are highly profitable. The hospital could invest in targeted marketing for these services and ensure that staff are trained to offer them efficiently.
                                                To replicate the success of top-performing doctors, the hospital should investigate their practices in detail to identify factors driving their high revenue. This could include patient engagement strategies, procedural focus, or even leadership roles within their specialties. Promoting these practices across other departments could lead to more consistent performance across the board
